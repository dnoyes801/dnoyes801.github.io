<div class="main"><p class="header" style="color: crimson">The most surprising data point to come out of this analysis was the rapid (near 10%) rate of population growth in Washington state.  My assumption was that immigration growth would be slow enough to where a booming urban center in the form of Seattle would not push their 10-year growth rate over around 8%.  I was proven wrong, and Washington is on track to becoming similarly population dense as states like Arizona and Georgia in the future, with few densely populated urban centers surrounded by suburbs and rural land.  Texasâ€™ growth surprises no one, with an immense rate of immigration from its neighbor, Mexico, and rapidly growing urban centers Austin, Dallas, and Houston. Austin in particular is looking like it may be another strong contender for an international hotspot similarly to New York City or Los Angeles in the next 30 years or so, with many tech industry jobs and tourist hotspots.  South Dakota is experiencing standard growth for its size  and is extremely loosely populated, leading to a steady rate of growth in its few urban centers.</p>
